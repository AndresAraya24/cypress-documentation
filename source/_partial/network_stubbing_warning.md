ðŸš¨ There is currently a limitation with [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route.html) since it only supports intercepting XMLHttpRequests. However, Cypress has a new experimental [`cy.route2()`](/api/commands/route2.html) feature that supports requests using the Fetch API and other types of network requests like page loads. For more information, check out the [`cy.route2()` documentation](/api/commands/route2.html).
