ðŸš¨ There is currently a limitation with Cypress [route](/api/commands/route.html) since it only supports intercepting XMLHttpRequests. However, Cypress has a new experimental [route2](/api/commands/route2.html) feature that supports requests using the Fetch API and other types of network requests like page loads. For more information, check out the [route2 documentation](/api/commands/route2.html).{% endnote %}
